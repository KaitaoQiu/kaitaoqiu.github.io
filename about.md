Hi, my name is Kaitao Qiu and this is my blog for trading and cs. I believe that you don't _really_ know what you're talking about unless you can present the information in a digestible and intuitive way. In order to ensure I really know the material I learned, I compile them in blogposts here.

I graduated from ZJU as a computer science major.

Most of the time, I write on this blog because I'm too lazy to take on some huge project and just want to chill and learn some fun stuff that's sometimes not useful.

If you have questions about what I wrote in my blog, don't hesitate to shoot me a message at `kt_qiu@qq.com` or just leave a comment on the blog. I'm just a human, so I make typos!
